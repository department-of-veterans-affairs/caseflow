# App Canvas

Almost all of the interaction in Caseflow takes place in an App Canvas. The content starts off with a page title and
minimal instructions for what the user needs to do to complete their task on the page. It then contains any interaction
that well help this to accomplish their task including forms, document previews, tables, error messages, and more.
The canvas has a default standard width but can be adjusted according to the needs of each application.
