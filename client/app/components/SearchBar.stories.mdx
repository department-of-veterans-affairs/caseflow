# Search Bar

Search bars are a block that allows users to search for specific content
if they know what search terms to use or canâ€™t find desired content in the main navigation.
In Caseflow they serve as a vital UI component that allows users to
find information necessary in completing their tasks.

Based on the app there are two sizes: big and small.
There is also a unique Caseflow search behavior that displays a spinning logo to indicate load times.

**Technical notes:** In the "Search Big" and the "Search Small" examples below,
click on the Search buttons to activate the loading spinner for a 2 second
period. For any search ahead search bars, the class `cf-search-ahead-parent`
must be applied to the parent element.

## Big

<Story story={SearchBarStories.Big} />

## Small

<Story story={SearchBarStories.Small} />

## Search Ahead

<Story story={SearchBarStories.SearchAhead} />

## Args

<ArgsTable of={SearchBar} />
