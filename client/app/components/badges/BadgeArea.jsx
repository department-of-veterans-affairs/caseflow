/**
 * Component to display a set of badges, currently limited to hearing, overtime badges, and FNOD badges.
 * Each badge should individually handle whether or not they should be displayed.
 * This component can accept either an Appeal object or a Task object. An appeal object should be passed in places where
 * we are strictly showing an appeal (in case details or case search). A Task object should be passed in places we do
 * have a task rather than an appeal (in queue task lists)
 * The default is for badges to be displayed listed vertically. Pass isHorizontal to display them horizontally
 * e.g.,
 *   <BadgeArea appeal={appeal} />
 *   <BadgeArea task={task} />
 **
 * These badges were created in the queue application, CASEFLOW-432 adds the FnodBadge to the hearings application
 * To do that the QueueFnodBadge was added, this is a container component which provides the queue state to the
 * FnodBadge component. This allows hearings to use FnodBadge with different feature toggle and tooltip state.
