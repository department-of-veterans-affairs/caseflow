# Loaders

A large Caseflow loading indicator in the center of the page is used when some
information has been retrieved but other information is still being pulled.
Each loader should have a message underneath the logo in `gray-dark`
that explains what is currently happening or where the information is being drawn
from. Loader should match the respective Caseflow app logo. Designers are
responsible for letting developers know that defaulted color in the source code needs
to be the color of the app logo.
See Caseflow Logos under the `Colors` section.
