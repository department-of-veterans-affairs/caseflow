Primary actions are visually prioritized by being solid blue `usa-button` style.

Finally, there are actions that we generally want to discourage but should remain visible to users as an escape hatch.

These actions can be `button-link` styles or use the `usa-button-secondary style`.
For example, the “Cancel” button frequently found at the bottom of Caseflow workflow layouts
is usually a button link because it launches a modal.
The button to confirm that a user wants to cancel is red and serves as a warning to the user
that the action is destructive. These styles should be used sparingly.

The width of the button will vary depending on the length of the content.
In the source code, the buttons are set so that there is always 20px padding on the left
and right of the text. While it is ideal not to change the default setting, in a case where
buttons of various widths are stacked, we highly recommend adjusting the padding of the buttons
so that they all match in width.

### Loading Button
Our button components are able to react to a *loading* property which,
when *true*, causes the button to show **Loading...**
beside a spinning icon.
