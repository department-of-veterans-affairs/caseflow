# Messages

Messages are a frequent layout used in Caseflow. These messages are shown when the user has completed a task, when
there is an error, and to indicate status.

All messages are shown in the standard App Canvas. The messages contain a `heading 1`, whose colors vary based on
`type`, and `lead` follow-up text. The follow up text often contains context and instructions on what the user can do
next.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={StatusMessageStories.Status} />
</Canvas>

## Success Messages

Success messages are shown when the user has successfully completed the intended task of the application. The title is
green, and these messages contain a checklist confirming the tasks the user has completed and displays actions performed
by Caseflow in the background, such as automatically sending a letter or changing the location of a claim.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={StatusMessageStories.Success} />
</Canvas>

## Alert Messages

Alert messages are often shown when the user has destroyed data by canceling their work. These messages have red titles
to reinforce that the user did not complete the intended task of the application, a brief explanation of what happened,
and next steps.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={StatusMessageStories.Alert} />
</Canvas>

## Warning Messages

Status messages are shown when Caseflow encounters an error such as 500 or 400 http error codes. They are also shown
when a user doesnâ€™t have access to view a particular page or application. These messages are more neutral with a
`dark-grey` title, an explanation of what is going on, and next steps the user can take.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={StatusMessageStories.Warning} />
</Canvas>

## Arguments

<ArgsTable of={StatusMessage} />
