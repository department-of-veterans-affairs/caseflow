      <h2 id="what-is-caseflow-intake">1. What is Caseflow Intake?</h2>
      <p>
      Caseflow Intake (Intake) is a web-based application designed to support the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).
      Used to process AMA appeals for Veterans who have chosen the new Supplemental Claim (SC) or Higher-Level Review
      (HLR) options as well as those who have chosen to appeal directly to the Board through a Notice of Disagreement
      (NOD). Intake serves as the single data input system for this process, providing a source of truth for AMA
      statutory metrics. For VBMS users, Intake creates an End Product (EP), route the EP to the appropriate
      destination, and close the VACOLS record automatically for eligible legacy opt-ins. Intake also guides Claims
      Assistants (CAs) through the process of notifying Veterans, updating necessary systems, and creating EPs.
      </p>

      <p>
      For non-VBMS users, Intake also provides a lightweight task list and facility to mark dispositions,
      closing the loop on appeals issues and assuring an end-to-end collection of AMA metrics. Across the board,
      Intake performs numerous issue-level validations, matching, and error checking, to capture the best possible
      data and reduce processing overhead.

      <h2 id="how-was-intake-developed">2. How was Intake developed?</h2>
      <p>
      The DSVA team worked closely with stakeholders across the VA to develop and test Intake.
      Using feedback from VA employees and human-centered design principles, DSVA has tweaked
      and improved the tool steadily. They will continue to improve the tool based on feedback and as
      they have more opportunities to make things simpler.
      </p>

      <h2 id="how-to-access-intake">3. How do I access Intake?</h2>
      <p>
      Each business line has identified a <strong>Caseflow Administrator</strong>, who acts as the point of contact
      for Caseflow issues for their line of business.
      </p>

      <p><strong>To gain access to Intake, your Caseflow Administrator must submit a request including:</strong></p>

      <h3>User Access List Submission</h3>
      <p>
      Please contact <a href="https://yourit.va.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YourIT</a> requesting
       access to Caseflow and provide a list of users with credential information (Name, Email, Station, and User ID).
      </p>

      <h3>Users may require Documents Submission (If requested)</h3>
      <p>
      Users not currently in CSEM may require documentation which includes TMS Certificates, access forms, and/or
      Credentialing Information. Have your group’s POC alert the users.
      </p>

      <p className="cf-red-text">
      The Caseflow support team does not have access to view CSEM access requests and therefore cannot provide the
      status of a user’s access. Users will be directed to contact their Caseflow Administrator for more information.
      </p>
