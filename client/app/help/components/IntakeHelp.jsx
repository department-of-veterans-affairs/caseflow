      <h2 id="what-is-caseflow-intake">1. What is Caseflow Intake?</h2>
      <p>Caseflow Intake (Intake) is a web-based application designed to support the Rapid Appeals
    Modernization Program (RAMP). It will help process legacy appeals for Veterans who have
    chosen to opt-in for the new Supplemental Claim (SC) or Higher Level Review (HLR) options.
    Intake will serve as the single intake system for this process. It will allow for identifying the
    selected option (SC or HLR) and details for a given Veteran's issues (pulled from VBMS),
    creating an End Product (EP), sending notifications to the Appellant, routing the EP to the
    appropriate destination, and closing the VACOLS record automatically for eligible opt-ins.
    Intake will guide Claims Assistants (CAs) through the process of notifying Veterans, updating
    necessary systems, and creating End Products (EPs). Intake was built by the Digital Service at
    VA (DSVA) and will create process improvements for many areas of the VA. Learn more:

      <h2 id="how-was-intake-developed">2. How was Intake developed?</h2>
      <p>The DSVA team worked closely with stakeholders across the VA to develop and test Intake.
    Using feedback from VA employees and human-centered design principles, DSVA has tweaked
    and improved the tool steadily. They will continue to improve the tool based on feedback and as
    they have more opportunities to make things simpler.
      </p>

      <h2 id="how-to-access-intake">3. How do I access Intake?</h2>
      <p>To gain access to Intake, you must submit a request to your Information Security Officer (ISO)
    and/or Information Resources Management (IRM) team to adjust your Common Security
    Employee Manager (CSEM) permissions. To initiate the request, draft an email requesting your
    current permissions be updated as follows:

      </p>

      <p>Once the email is drafted, attach a copy of your latest “VA Privacy and Information Security
    Awareness and Rules of Behavior” training certificate and forward the email to your supervisor
    for approval. If approved, your supervisor should forward the request to your station’s IRM team
