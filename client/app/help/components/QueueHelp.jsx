      <h2 id="what-is-caseflow-queue">1. What is Caseflow Queue?</h2>

      <p>
        Caseflow Queue is a web-based workflow management tool designed to help manage and track
        appeals through the appeals process. It currently supports the legacy appeals process, and
        eventually will support the new appeals lanes and policies established by the Veterans Appeals
        Improvement and Modernization Act (AMA)
      </p>

      <h2 id="how-was-queue-developed">2. How was Queue developed?</h2>

      <p>
        The Digital Service at VA (DSVA) team worked closely with employees and other stakeholders
        at BVA, to develop and test a Queue prototype. Using feedback from VA employees and human centered
        design principles, DSVA has tweaked and improved the tool steadily, and will continue
        improving the tool as they collect more feedback from its users.
      </p>

      <h2 id="launch-queue">3. How do I launch Queue?</h2>

      <p>
        You can launch Queue by visiting the URL, <a href="https://appeals.cf.ds.va.gov/queue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> https://appeals.cf.ds.va.gov/queue</a>,
         in your Google Chrome browser and logging in with you VA credentials. You will be taken to the <b>Your Queue </b> page.
      </p>

      <h2 id="queue-get-cases">4. Where does Queue get cases?</h2>

      <p>
        Queue retrieves appeals assigned to you from the Decision Assignment Sheet (DAS).
      </p>

      <h2 id="veteran-data">5. Where does the Veteran and appeal data in Queue come from?</h2>

      <p>
        Caseflow retrieves Veteran and Queue data from VACOLS and displays it in Queue. Our hope is
        that you rely on Caseflow, rather than VACOLS or DAS, for this data.
      </p>

      <h2 id="cases-not-assigned-to-me">6. How can I see cases that are not assigned to me?</h2>

      <p>
       You can search for cases that are not assigned to you by entering a Veteran ID in the search bar
       in the top left of the screen. You will see all cases associated with that Veteran and can click on
       the Veteran’s name to get to that particular case’s details screen. From the case details screen,
       you can navigate to Reader to view the claims folder
      </p>

      <h2 id="encounter-problems">7. What should I do if I encounter problems?</h2>
