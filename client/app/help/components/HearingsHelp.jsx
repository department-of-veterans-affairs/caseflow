      <h2 id="what-is-caseflow-hearing-PREP">1. What is Caseflow Hearing Prep?</h2>

      <p>Caseflow Hearing Prep helps judges rapidly prepare for their hearings. It allows judges to view their upcoming hearings, view relevant appellant information, take notes before and during a hearing, and review documents in the veteran's eFolder.
        Hearing Prep was built by the Digital Service at VA (DSVA) and will create cost savings and process improvements for many areas at the VA. Learn more:
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/hearingprep_training_guide_june2018.pdf">Training Guide</a>
      </p>

      <h2 id="how-was-hearing-developed">2. How was Hearing Prep developed?</h2>

      <p>The Digital Service at VA (DSVA) team worked closely with judges at BVA and other stakeholders across VA, to develop and test a Hearing Prep prototype. Using feedback from VA employees and human-centered design principles, DSVA has tweaked and improved the tool steadily, and will continue improving the tool as they collect more feedback from its users.
      </p>

      <h2 id="how-to-access-hearing-prep">3. How do I get access to Hearing Prep?</h2>

      <p>To gain access to Hearing Prep, you must submit a request to your Information Security Officer (ISO) and/or Information Resources Management (IRM) team to adjust your Common Security Employee Manager (CSEM) permissions. To initiate the request, draft an email requesting your current permissions be updated as follows:
      </p>

      <p className="cf-help-image-wrapper">
        <img className="cf-help-image" alt="Hearing Access" src="/assets/help/hearing-access.jpg" />
      </p>

      <p>Once the email is drafted, attach a copy of your latest “VA Privacy and Information Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior” training certificate and forward the email to your supervisor for approval. If approved, your supervisor should forward the request to your station’s IRM team and/or ISO for entry into CSEM. You will receive an email notice once access is granted.
      </p>

      <h2 id="launch-hearing-prep">4. How do I launch Hearing Prep?</h2>

      <p>To launch Hearing Prep, open Google Chrome and paste the following URL into the browser: <a href="https://appeals.cf.ds.va.gov/hearings/dockets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> https://appeals.cf.ds.va.gov/hearings/dockets</a>.

      <p>To view your hearing docket for a specific day, on the <b> Your Hearing Days </b> page (days with scheduled hearing), click on the date that you would like to view. You will be taken to the <b>Daily Docket</b> for that specific date and will be able to view all the hearings scheduled for that day.
      You will be able to click on a hearing date up to 30 days before the hearing. We pull in the most recent updates as close as possible to the hearing date. You may also access <b>Hearing Worksheets</b> from hearings held within the past year from the <b> Your Hearing Days Past</b> hearings tab.
      </p>

      <h2 id="information-included-on-hearing-worksheet">6. What information is included on the Hearing Worksheet?</h2>
      <p> On the <b> Hearing Worksheet </b>, you will be able to view “Appellant/Veteran Information”, “Procedural History” and issues on appeal. You can type notes in these fields: “Contentions”,

      <p>The "Notes" listed on the <b>Daily Docket</b> are pulled from VACOLS and typically include contextual information related to the hearing. When the Hearing Coordinator enters notes in VACOLS, they are visible to you in the “Notes” field of Hearing Prep. Refreshing the
        Daily <b>Docket page</b> in the Google Chrome browser allows you to see the most recent updates in the "Notes" field.
      </p>

      <h2 id="see-latest-notes">9. How do I see the latest Notes from the Hearing Coordinator on the Daily Docket?</h2>

         write back to VACOLS. You can also track the hearings that are prepped on the <b>Hearing Worksheet</b> itself. When you check the Prep checkbox on the <b>Hearing Worksheet</b>, it will also
         be updated on the <b>Select a Veteran</b> menu.
      </p>

      <h2 id="return-to-upcoming">12. How do I return to the Your Hearing Days page?</h2>

      </p>

      <h2 id="use-veteran-id-button">14. How can I use the Veteran ID button on the Hearing Worksheet?</h2>
      <p>
        By clicking on the <b>Veteran ID</b> button on the <b>Hearing Worksheet</b>, you will be able to copy the Veteran’s ID to the clipboard and easily paste it into the Digital Audio Recording System
        (DARS) recording interface in the BVA hearing rooms.
      </p>

      <h2 id="delete-issues-hearing-worksheet">15. How do I add or delete issues on the Hearing Worksheet?</h2>

      <p>To add an issue, click the <b>+ Add Issue</b> button located on the left side of the Issues section of the Hearing Worksheet. A row of boxes will appear below the last issue. Complete the boxes with the required information. To delete an issue, click the <b>trash can</b> icon located to the right of the issue. A Remove Issue Row confirmation box appears. Click <b>Yes</b> to confirm the deletion. Remember, removing the issue on the Hearing Worksheet does not remove the issue from VACOLS.
      </p>

      <h2 id="issue-notes-hearing">16. Where do the Issue Notes on the Hearing Worksheet come from?</h2>

      <p>The "Issue Notes" on the <b>Hearing Worksheet</b> are pulled from VACOLS.</p>

      <h2 id="information-on-hearing-worksheet-saved-vacols">17. What information on the Hearing Prep is saved to VACOLS?</h2>

      <p>On the <b>Daily Docket</b>, "Actions", "Notes", and "Transcript Requested" are saved back to VACOLS.
      On the <b>Hearing Worksheet</b>, the only field that saves back to VACOLS is the "Rep Name".
      </p>

      <h2 id="preliminary-mpressions-boxes">18. How are the Preliminary Impressions boxes on the Hearing Worksheet used?</h2>

      <p>The "Preliminary Impressions" boxes are used to indicate your first thoughts about the issues associated with the case.
       You may select more than one or none at all. The issue indicators are Re-Open, Dismiss, Allow, Deny, Remand, and OMO.
      </p>

      <h2 id="review-veterans-claims-eFolder">19. How do I review the Veteran’s Claims Folder?</h2>

      <p>To begin reviewing the veteran's claims folder, click the <b>Review claims folder</b> button located at the top right-hand corner of the <b>Hearing Worksheet</b> page.
      </p>

      <h2 id="case-summary-category-in-reader">20. What does the Case Summary category in Reader represent?</h2>

         Appeal to Board of Appeals, the Rating Decision Narrative, the Rating Decision Codesheet, Supplement Statement of Case, VA8 Certification of Appeal, DD Form 214 – Certificate of

         Organization as Claimant’s Representative, VA 21-22a Appointment of Individual as Claimant’s Representative, Hearing Transcript, and any document added in the last 30 days.

      </p>

      <h2 id="trade-case-with-another-judge">22. How will I access Hearing Worksheets when I trade a case with another judge?</h2>

      <p>
       In order to access a case you have traded with another judge, you will need to coordinate the trade with your Hearing Coordinator. The Hearing Coordinator will make the required
       changes and the case will be displayed on the <b>Your Hearing Days</b> page in Hearing Prep.
      </p>

      <h2 id="assign-case-to-another-VLJ">23. If I prep a hearing using Hearing Prep and then go into the Virtual Docket in VACOLs and assign the
       case to another VLJ, who is also using Hearing Prep, will he or she be able to see my notes? </h2>

      <p>
        Yes. The information updated on the <b>Daily Docket</b> in Hearing Prep is copied to VACOLS and the information updated on the <b>Hearing Worksheet</b> is copied to Caseflow. The other judge
        should be able to see your notes when he or she logs into Hearing Prep, since the information is not assigned to a specific individual (or judge).
      </p>

      <h2 id="case-ready-for-decision">24. How do I know if a case that’s ready for decision has included a hearing?</h2>

      <p>
      For any case that is included a hearing, Caseflow Reader’s <b>Cases Checked in</b> page (<b>Welcome to Reader!</b> Page) will display the Veteran’s name followed by a link to the <b>Hearing
      Worksheet.</b>
      </p>

      <h2 id="video-hearing">25. How do I access Hearing Prep during a video hearing?</h2>

      the hearing rooms. You no longer need to use the VACOLS Virtual Docket or VBMS.
      </p>

      <h2 id="access-prep-during-travel">26. How will I access Hearing Prep during travel board?</h2>

      <p>
       To access Hearing Prep on the travel board, open the Google Chrome browser on the Regional Office’s (RO) computer and type in the Hearing Prep
