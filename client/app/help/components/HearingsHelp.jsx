      <h2 id="what-is-caseflow-hearing-PREP">1. What is Caseflow Hearing Prep?</h2>

      <p>Caseflow Hearing Prep helps judges rapidly prepare for their hearings. It allows judges to view their upcoming hearings, view relevant appellant information, take notes before and during a hearing, and review documents in the veteran's eFolder. Hearing Prep was built by the Digital Service at VA (DSVA) and will create cost savings and process improvements for many areas at the VA. Learn more:

      </p>

      <h2 id="how-was-hearing-developed">2. How was Hearing Prep developed?</h2>

      <p>The Digital Service at VA (DSVA) team worked closely with judges at BVA and other stakeholders across VA, to develop and test a Hearing Prep prototype. Using feedback from VA employees and human-centered design principles, DSVA has tweaked and improved the tool steadily, and will continue improving the tool as they collect more feedback from its users.
      </p>

      <h2 id="how-to-access-hearing-prep">3. How do I get access to Hearing Prep?</h2>

      <p>To gain access to Hearing Prep, you must submit a request to your Information Security Officer (ISO) and/or Information Resources Management (IRM) team to adjust your Common Security Employee Manager (CSEM) permissions. To initiate the request, draft an email requesting your current permissions be updated as follows:

        <img className="cf-help-image" alt="Hearing Access" src="/assets/help/hearing-access.jpg" />
      </p>

      <p>Once the email is drafted, attach a copy of your latest “VA Privacy and Information Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior” training certificate and forward the email to your supervisor for approval. If approved, your supervisor should forward the request to your station’s IRM team and/or ISO for entry into CSEM. You will receive an email notice once access is granted.
