# Dashboard

Each Caseflow application has a business dashboard to help the team and our stakeholders track the performance of the
application. Metrics specific to the application are determined by the team before the dashboard is built. These metrics
often include basic usage numbers, time to complete task metrics, success rates, and more.

Dashboards are featured on the standard App Canvas. Data is broken up by tabs so the user can view data by hours, days,
weeks, or months.

Each data point has includes the metric title and quantity for the selected time period. It also has a chart displaying
historical data for that same data point.

Users can hover over historical points on the chart to show the data point for that specific time.
