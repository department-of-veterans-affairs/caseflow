  <p>Status messages are shown when Caseflow encounters an error such as 500 or 400
    http error codes. They are also shown when a user doesnâ€™t have access to view a
    particular page or application. These messages are more neutral with a
    <code>dark-grey</code> title, an explanation of what is going on, and next steps
    the user can take.</p>
  </div>;
