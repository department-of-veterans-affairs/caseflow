### Description

### Technical notes

### Context

### External service requests


*Instructions (delete this section)*
This template is for Foxtrot engineers to use when adding new tickets.  The goal is for the ticket to have enough of a description for a non-engineer to have an idea of what it is without having to look at an alert or Slack thread.

*Description*
Please include a description of the issue to the best you can.  If you don't know much (e.g. it's from an error that hasn't been investigated yet), maybe say it's due to a bug and include a snippet of the alert.

*Technical notes*
Please include any additional useful information you have for an engineer that might pick this up.

*Context*
A place to include links to related issues, PRs, Sentry alerts or Slack threads that could be useful to the engineer.

*External service requests*
Please include links to any related service requests or incident reports
