# Tech Spec Title
**Drafter**: <!-- Your name -->  
**Discussion Meeting**: <!-- Date to discussion the spec as a team; send calendar invite! -->  

<!-- Tech specs are a lightweight format for documenting technical research and decision making. The headings below are guidelines, not rules, so modify your copy as you see fit. Especially large tech specs may require more headings and subheadings for example. Be rigorous in your research and planning, but balance that with forward progress - if something is uncertain, document that appropriately and move on if you can. Getting feedback early from team mates during tech spec writing can be helpful too.
Tech specs are considered 'done' when key stakeholders have reviewed and approved the approach. -->

## Context
<!-- Why are you creating this tech spec? 

<!-- What information helps readers understand the rest of this tech spec? 

<!-- Who are the stakeholders? -->

## Overview
<!-- A brief summary of research, findings, and recommendations. -->

## Open Questions
<!-- Sometimes we're missing information needed to fully spec work. 
What is missing? Who can answer these questions, and how might it affect the recommendation? -->

## Implementation Options
<!-- 
Consider multiple implementation paths.
What are their recommended action items?
These may change as feedback is given, but after the tech spec is approved these should be written as fully defined/pointed github issues.
Is the work sufficiently defined such that someone else could pick it up?
Is the work parallelizable?
What new API endpoints, database fields / tables / models need to be defined?
How will we safely ship this work? Are there migrations, external dependencies that need to be notified, documentation changes, etc? -->

## Test Plan
<!-- How do we validate this work? What types of testing is required? -->

## Rollout Plan
<!-- Is there a phased rollout? What needs to be done to mitigate rollout risks? -->

## Research Notes
<!-- Add any accrued research, links to relevant meeting notes, and sources of truth. This is also a good place to document any history to the recommended implementation - if feedback has changed the final approach, leave a note about it here -->

# Tech Spec Process

 - [ ] Tech spec drafter: Schedule time to discuss the tech spec.
 - [ ] Tech spec drafter: Facilitate that discussion.
 - [ ] Other developers: Read the tech spec before arriving at the discussion.
 - [ ] Other developers: Remind the tech spec drafter if a tech spec has been produced and no meeting has been scheduled.
 - [ ] Tech spec drafter: Turn tech spec into next-step actionable tickets.
    - [ ] Write tickets as is necessary
    - [ ] Other developers provide more formal feedback as is necessary.
