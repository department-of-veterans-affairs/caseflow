<!-- The goal of this template is to be a tool to help write good design, research, and writing tasks that stem off of a user story and/or epic. It is not intended as a mandate, adapt as needed. -->

## User story
<!-- Include a user story, if it exists. Be specific about which users you're talking about, please. -->

## Problem statement
<!-- Describe the problem the design, writing, or research is intended to solve. -->

## What is out of scope?
<!-- This can be particularly helpful for research tickets. Does not need to be an exhaustive list, but should clearly define the boundaries of the work -->

## Background/context
<!-- Why are we designing/writing this? Who is it for? What research has been done that tells us this needs to be designed, written, or researched? -->

## What are the unknowns?
<!-- If there are key unknowns or assumptions, add them here. If we're accepting the risks associated with the unknowns or assumptions, let us know that too. -->

## For research tickets only: What questions do we hope to answer? What are our learning goals?
<!-- It can be useful to also include questions we're not trying to answer. -->

## For writing tickets only: Writing guidance, if possible, such as voice and tone desired, relevant styleguides, and who the approvers should be.

## Existing design and content
<!--If we're replacing something, please include a screenshot(s) or link to the existing solution, even if it's not in Caseflow. -->

## Success criteria
<!-- Include as needed, especially for issues that aren't part of epics. if no measurable success criteria, what does success look like? -->

## Technical/logistical constraints (if known)
<!-- Are there technical constraints that will impact any design or writing solution? Logistical constraints that will impact user research? -->
