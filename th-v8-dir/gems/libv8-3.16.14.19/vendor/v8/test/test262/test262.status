############################### BUGS ###################################

# '__proto__' should be treated as a normal property in JSON.
S15.12.2_A1: FAIL

# Sequencing of getter side effects on receiver and argument properties
# is wrong. The receiver callback should be called before any arguments
# are evaluated.
# V8 Bug: http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=691
11.2.3-3_3: FAIL

# Strings that are considered canonically equivalent by the Unicode standard
# return a non-zero value on String.prototype.localeCompare calls.

15.5.4.9_CE: FAIL

##################### DELIBERATE INCOMPATIBILITIES #####################

# This tests precision of Math functions.  The implementation for those
# trigonometric functions are platform/compiler dependent.  Furthermore, the
# expectation values by far deviates from the actual result given by an
# arbitrary-precision calculator, making those tests partly bogus.
S15.8.2.8_A6: PASS || FAIL_OK   # Math.exp (less precise with --fast-math)
S15.8.2.16_A7: PASS || FAIL_OK  # Math.sin
S15.8.2.18_A7: PASS || FAIL_OK  # Math.tan

# Linux for ia32 (and therefore simulators) default to extended 80 bit floating
# point formats, so these tests checking 64-bit FP precision fail. The other
# platforms/arch's pass these tests.
# We follow the other major JS engines by keeping this default.

############################ INVALID TESTS #############################

# The reference value calculated by Test262 is incorrect if you run these tests
# in PST/PDT between first Sunday in March and first Sunday in April. The DST
# switch was moved in 2007 whereas Test262 bases the reference value on 2000.
