### Meetings

- **Goal: Respect teammates' time during meetings**
  - Practice: Schedule meetings for 20 minutes or 50 minutes
  - Practice: Include those who could be interested/valuable in the meeting, but instill the norm that teammates don't feel obligated to attend meetings
   - Practice: Meeting leader establishes laptop policy at the start of each meeting
- **Goal: Continuous meeting improvement/audit**
  - Practice: Each teammate has the right to ask why there needs to be a meeting for a topic. That teammate should propose an alternative.
- **Goal: Make meetings productive**
  - Practice: Meetings should have an agenda. The agenda is primarily - **what are the decisions that need to be made during this meeting.** Communicate agenda in meeting invite and/or Slack in advance.
  - Practice: Every meeting has a facilitator.  A facilitator keeps the discussion on topic, tells people when to take things offline if they're getting side-tracked, prepares and keeps the agenda, drives decisions and action items. 
  - Practice: If there are to be meeting notes, the facilitator is not the notetaker
  - Practice: If there are next steps or to-do’s with deadlines at the end of a meeting, they should be reiterated at the end of the meeting.
  - Practice: All to-dos or actionable items should be assigned to someone to take ownership of 
- **Goal: Cultivate creativity/flexibility within sprint teams**
  - Practice: Sprint teams are empowered to institute team meetings, as long as they are not at the expense of team wide meetings.

### Engineering
- **Goal: Have an effective Standup**
  - Practice: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/caseflow/issues/1703#issuecomment-297436941 
  - Post updates in the #appeals-engineering channel on Slack if you can't make team standup
- **Goal: Effective engineering collaboration and code review**
  - Practice: Read through these miscellaneous engineering norms -
 https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/caseflow/blob/master/docs/misc_eng_norms.md
  - Practice: Waffle column process - https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/caseflow/blob/master/docs/process.md
- **Goal: Don't ruin veterans' lives.**
  - Practice: Every pull request that involves writing data to a system we don't control (like VACOLS) must be approved by **two** reviewers. (It's ok if the second reviewer focuses on the data writing and ignores irrelevant aspects of the PR like a UI change.) The person sending the pull request is responsible for ensure that this happens.

### Productivity
- **Goal: Allow for periodic uninterrupted work time / Support project speed**
  - Practice: Build the habit for few to no meetings on the first Thursday of the sprint.
  - Practice: Team members can work from wherever they are most productive on the first Thursday of the sprint.

### General communication
- **Goal: Be productive while some team members are remote.** When you're not at BVA:
  - Practice: Post on slack in `#status` when you're starting and stopping work for the day, as well as significant AFK periods.
  - For more inspiration, see [The Effective Remote Developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW7_AteiM4o)
- **Goal: Cultivate a culture of open communication**
  - Practice: Over-communication is welcome!
  - Practice: If you have side conversations, post results on Slack or github for team transparency.
- **Goal: Help teammates grow professionally** 
  - Practice: Sprint team leads will give engineers feedback regularly and vice versa.
  - Practice: VA Eng Lead has monthly 1:1s with each engineer.
- **Goal: Avoid being blocked on each other**
  - Practice: When you're waiting for someone to do something for you, like review a PR, ping to let them know. If they don't respond for day, ping them again. Some people do not keep up with their GitHub notifications, so simply assigning a ticket or PR to someone is insufficient.
 
### Work/Life Balance
- **Goal: Protect work/life balance when contacting others outside business hours**
  - Practice: Configure slack with "do not disturb" for non-work hours.
  - Practice: Individuals may ping any person at any time on slack, and the slack "do not disturb" setting will appropriately prevent notifications outside of working hours. If helpful, recipient can use the context menu (right-click on desktop, press and hold on mobile) “Remind me about this message…” option so that it doesn’t get lost.
  - Practice: Responses to emails and slack notifications are not expected outside of working hours.  For true emergency situations, call someone's phone, which can be found in their slack profile.
- **Goal: Allow teammates to enjoy vacation how they like when they are on vacation**
  - Practice: When you are going on vacation, establish a person for teammates to go to in your stead.
  - Practice: Make every effort not to contact teammates when they are on vacation.
