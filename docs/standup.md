# Standup

Standup is a standard way that agile development teams stay in sync, identify blockers, and build quickly. Our team is a bit unusual, because we have many people operating in a single monolithic codebase. And, many of our teams work very closely together, and some people work across teams. Long term, we may wish to address those issues directly. In the interim, we're going to structure our standup to be optimally useful for this unusual situation.

Our standup routine has three parts:

* **10:15a** – Sprint team standup
* **10:30a** – Entire team standup
* **10:45a** – Optional post-standup discussion
* **11:00a** – Hard stop.

To describe each part:

## Sprint Team Standup
Each sprint team listed in [`priorities.md`](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/appeals-pm/blob/master/priorities.md) will meet:

| Team | Room |
| --- | --- |
| Whiskey | Bespin |
| Tango | Naboo |
| Foxtrot | Endor | 
| Devops | ??? |
| Harambe | Anoat |
| QA? | ??? |

The sprint team standup can be cancelled at the team leads' discretion. Each team is responsible for their own dial-in system for remote teammates (Slack call, Google Hangout, just calling the one remote person on the phone, etc). People who are not attached to a specific team are welcome at any standup, but only as observers.

Sprint team standup is a good time to discuss things like:

* Blockers
* What people should work on that day
* Identifying potential conflicts ("my work may step on your toes; let's chat offline.")
* Syncing on the plan for the day ("If you get me the PR by lunch, I can have it back to you by 2p.")

As always, the key to a good standup is setting the stage for doing work, not actually doing work in the meeting.

Sprint team standup is cross-functional. Engineers, designers, and product people all attend the same standup.
