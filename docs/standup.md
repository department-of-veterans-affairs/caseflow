# Standup

Standup is a standard way that agile development teams stay in sync, identify blockers, and build quickly. Our team is a bit unusual, because we have many people operating in a single monolithic codebase. And, many of our teams work very closely together, and some people work across teams. Long term, we may wish to address those issues directly. In the interim, we're going to structure our standup to be optimally useful for this unusual situation.

Our standup routine has three parts:

* **10:15a** – Sprint team standup
* **10:30a** – Entire team standup
* **10:45a** – Optional post-standup discussion
* **11:00a** – Hard stop.
