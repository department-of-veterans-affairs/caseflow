# Contributing to Styleguide

## How can I request that something is put in the style guide?
In an upcoming story, make it an AC item that the UI component you'd like to add should
be placed in the style guide. IE:
_screen shot here about that_

Ideally, the same developer that picks up that story should also be the one to add it to the styleguide (see below information on that).

If we currently have that UI component in an application but no information on the style guide about that component, create a ticket and label it with `styleguide` for a developer to pick up.

## (For developers) What can I add to style guide?
Similar to our current products, we put tickets that we'd like to work in "Current Sprint"
for the current sprint. However, tickets that are also in "Ready for Dev" are good to work
on too if there is nothing in the "Current Sprint" section. Here is the unofficial hierarchy of what to contribute for style guide (starting with most important to least important):

* Any story that implements a new UI component
* Any story lists "add this [UI component] to style guide" (for new or existing UI components)
* "Current Sprint" tickets
* "Ready for Dev" tickets
