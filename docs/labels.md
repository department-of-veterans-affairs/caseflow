From now, if you want to add a label, you need to run it by the team, so everyone agrees what it means and we can add it to this list:

##Labels!
- **bug** A bug that has been found with code in production. Any bugs with stories that have not yet been completed should be handled on that issue.
- **starter-task** An issue that would be good for a new developer to work on. Because it's easy.
- **tech-improvement** An issue that has to do with removing technical debt, or improving a technical issue with the application (e.g. upgrading the version of Ruby), and may not have a visible effect in the UX.
- **feature-definition** An issue that needs more definition before it can be developed.
- **icebox** An issue that has been deprioritized. Left to die at the bottom of the backlog.
- **blocked** The issue cannot be completed because of an issue that needs to be resolved outside of your control. Leave blocked issues on the "In Progress" column so we can review them during standup.
- **feature labels (caseflow-certification, caseflow-dispatch):**  Used to determine which feature of the application the issue has to do with. Only applicable for the `caseflow` repo.
- **column labels** There are labels for each of the waffle columns. See <https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/caseflow/blob/master/docs/process.md> for more information on these.
- **team labels (tango, foxtrot)** Used to designate that a specific sprint team will be working on this issue.

##Labels we'll be removing
contractor-ready (use starter-task instead)
Specific sprint columns (i.e. "Sprint 11/17")
labels relating to the old waffle board (i.e. "certification - maintenance")
enhancement - everything is an enhancement, otherwise we wouldn't do it.
epic - Epics should be dealt with in Appeals PM
