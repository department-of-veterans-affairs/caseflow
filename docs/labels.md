From now, if you want to add a label, you need to run it by the team, so everyone agrees what it means and we can add it to this list:

## Labels Definitions
- **blocked** - The issue cannot be completed because of an issue that needs to be resolved outside of your control. Leave blocked issues on the In Progress column so we can review them during standup.
- **bug-high-priority** - A bug that has been found with code in production. Data loss, data corruption or system unavailable
- **bug-low-priority** - A bug that has been found with code or design in production. Cosemtic issues with minor effects on functionality.
- **bug-medium-priority** - A bug that has been found with code in production. Important functionality is unavailable but there is a workaround
- **column labels** - There are labels for each of the waffle columns. See <https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/caseflow/blob/master/docs/process.md> for more information on these.
- **discussion** An issue used for the team to discuss solutions and ideas related to a high level problem. The team can discuss on the issue for some amount of time, and possibly come together in person to determine the outcome.
- **feature labels (caseflow-certification, caseflow-dispatch)** - Used to determine which feature of the application the issue has to do with. Only applicable for the \`caseflow\` repo.
- **feature-definition** - An issue that needs more definition before it can be developed.
- **high-priority** - A visible way to mark an issue as high priority.
- **icebox** - An issue that has been deprioritized. Left to die at the bottom of the backlog.
- **obsolete** - A story that is no longer needed. It was not developed.
- **requirements-incorrect** - Acceptance criteria are unclear/outdated/require additional definition.
- **starter-task** - An issue that would be good for a new developer to work on. Because it's easy.
- **team labels (tango, foxtrot)** - Used to designate that a specific sprint team will be working on this issue.
- **tech-improvement** - An issue that has to do with removing technical debt, or improving a technical issue with the application (e.g. upgrading the version of Ruby), and may not have a visible effect in the UX.
- **validation-failed** - Implementation does not follow acceptance criteria.
