# Caseflow APIs

## Overview

Caseflow provides HTTP APIs for consumption by external services. Generally these APIs expose
Caseflow data in a read-only pattern via specific queries, although some API endpoints do allow for modifying
Caseflow data (e.g. Caseflow Jobs, IDT).

All API responses are in JSON format.

All API requests prefer to keep sensitive PII out of URLs and instead inside HTTP headers. This helps prevent
leaking PII into logs and unauthorized communication channels.

Only actively maintained APIs are documented here. See the Git log history of this document for details.

## API Keys

All API requests require a valid API key token, which is passed in the `Authorization` HTTP header. See the `curl`
examples below for the proper syntax.

If you need an API key, you can request one via [YourIT](https://yourit.va.gov/).

If you are a Caseflow administrator, you can create a key in the Caseflow Rails console:

```bash
irb> api_key = ApiKey.create!(consumer_name: "Some Application")
irb> api_key.key_string
# the key string is what you pass in the HTTP header
```

## Caseflow Jobs

You may `POST /api/v1/jobs` with the `job_type` body parameter in order to create a new Shoryuken-based job.
The list of job types available is in
[the controller](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/caseflow/blob/master/app/controllers/api/v1/jobs_controller.rb#L5).

```bash
% curl -XPOST -H 'Authorization: Token your-sekrit-key' \
       https://appeals.cf.ds.va.gov/api/v1/jobs -d 'job_type=sync_intake'
```

On success you would receive a response with HTTP code `200` and body like:

```json
{"success":true, "job_id":"5beec69d-a777-497e-b65d-2ac488b507ba"}
```

On failure you would receive a response with HTTP code `422` and body like:

```json
{"error_code":"Unable to start unrecognized job"}
```

or if the API key was missing or not found, a HTTP code `401` and body like:

```json
{"status":"unauthorized"}
```

## va.gov Appeals Status

The Appeals Status feature of va.gov allows Veterans to see details about their cases.

[Additional documentation is available](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/caseflow/wiki/Appeal-Status-API).

You may `GET /api/v2/appeals` with the Veteran Social Security Number (SSN) in the `ssn` HTTP header
and a `source` string of your choosing.

```bash
% curl -H 'Authorization: Token your-sekrit-key' \
       -H 'ssn: 987654321' \
       -H 'source: white house hotline' \
       https://appeals.cf.ds.va.gov/api/v2/appeals
```

On success you would receive a `200` HTTP code and a body like:

```json

         "attributes" : {
            "active" : false,

         "id" : "2760964",
         "type" : "legacyAppeal"
      }
   ]
}
```

If you provide an invalid SSN, the response would be a `422` HTTP code and a body like:

```json
{
   "errors" : [
      {
         "detail" : "Please enter a valid 9 digit SSN in the 'ssn' header",
         "status" : "422",
         "title" : "Invalid SSN"
      }
   ]
}
```

Other invalid request parameters would receive similarly formatted error responses.

## IDT

The Interactive Decision Template (IDT) is a set of Microsoft Word macros that allow for authoring and publishing
BVA decisions natively in Word. The IDT API allows Word to pre-populate the document with Veteran data from
VACOLS/Caseflow.

There are several endpoints available in the IDT API.

#### `GET /idt/api/v1/token`

Returns a one-time key and token for subsequent requests.

```bash
% curl -H 'Authorization: Token your-sekrit-key' https://appeals.cf.ds.va.gov/idt/api/v1/token
```

On success returns a `200` HTTP code and a body like:

```json
{
   "one_time_key" : "a-long-128-byte-string",
   "token" : "another-long-128-byte-string"
}
```

#### `GET /idt/auth?one_time_key=:your-one-time-key`

Activates an IDT session based on a one-time key. The default IDT session is 7 days.

**NOTE** this is typically done via a web browser since it requires
an active authenticated Caseflow browser session to link with a Caseflow user account.

```bash
% curl -H 'Authorization: Token your-sekrit-key' \
       https://appeals.cf.ds.va.gov/idt/auth?one_time_key=a-long-128-byte-string
```

On success returns a `200` HTTP code and body like:

```json
{"message":"Success!"}
```

On error returns a `400` code with an error message like:

```json
{"message":"Invalid key."}
```

Once the IDT session is activated, the `token` is passed in subsequent requests.

#### `GET /idt/api/v1/appeals`

```bash
% curl -H 'TOKEN: your-idt-token' \
       -H 'FILENUMBER: veteran-file-number' \
       https://appeals.cf.ds.va.gov/idt/api/v1/appeals
```

#### `GET /idt/api/v1/appeals/:appeal_id`

```bash
% curl -H 'TOKEN: your-idt-token' \
       https://appeals.cf.ds.va.gov/idt/api/v1/appeals/uuid_or_vacols_id
```

#### `POST /idt/api/v1/appeals/:appeal_id/outcode`

#### `POST /idt/api/v1/appeals/:appeal_id/upload_document`

#### `GET /idt/api/v1/judges`

```bash
% curl -H 'TOKEN: your-idt-token' \
       https://appeals.cf.ds.va.gov/idt/api/v1/judges
```

#### `GET /idt/api/v1/user`

```bash
% curl -H 'TOKEN: your-idt-token' \
       https://appeals.cf.ds.va.gov/idt/api/v1/user
```

#### `GET /idt/api/v1/veterans`

```bash
% curl -H 'TOKEN: your-idt-token' \
       -H 'FILENUMBER: veteran-file-number' \
       https://appeals.cf.ds.va.gov/idt/api/v1/veterans
```

## VETText / Hearings

The Hearings API returns all the hearings scheduled for a given day.

```bash
% curl -H 'Authorization: Token your-sekrit-key' \
       https://appeals.cf.ds.va.gov/api/v2/hearings/2019-06-07
```

On success returns `200` HTTP code and a body like:

```json
{
   "hearings" : [
      {
         "address" : "15 New Sudbury Street JFK Federal Building",
         "appeal" : "182fd411-c770-44c8-8491-0de36ac6f92c",

      }
   ]
}
```
