# README

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for [Caseflow](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/caseflow)

## Purpose of the `gh-pages` branch

This branch ([`gh-pages`](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/caseflow/tree/gh-pages)) is used by GitHub Pages. This branch is not intended to be merged in the main branch. Not that it has a completely separate commit history from the main branch. For more info, see ...

This branch has files for documentation. Some are automatically generated (e.g., by a GitHub Action); others are manually created.

Why not wiki?

* with GitHub Pages http://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/caseflow/

## Cloning / Checkout

## Committing changes

Anyone can commit to this branch without a peer-review, just like the Caseflow wiki page. Instead of committing directly to this branch, create a development branch and do a squash-merge when you are satisfied with the changes, just like what is done in the main branch.
