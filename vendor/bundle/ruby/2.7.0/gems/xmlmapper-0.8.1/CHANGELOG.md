## 0.8.1 / 2021-08-13

* Version 0.8.0 fixed a bug with newer versions of nokogiri, however due to the way this fix works it breaks compatability with
  older versions so we now added `'nokogiri', '~> 1.11'` as dependency 
* Update gemspec

## 0.8.0 / 2021-08-12

### WARNING: COMPATABILITY (see 0.8.1)

## 0.5.9 / 2014-02-18

* Correctly output boolean element value 'false'  (confusion)

## 0.5.8 / 2013-10-12

* Allow child elements to remove their parent's namespacing (dcarneiro)
* has_many elements were returning nil because the tag name was being ignored (haarts)
* Subclassed xmlmapper classes are allowed to override elements (benoist)
* Attributes on elements with dashes will properly created methods (alex-klepa)

## 0.5.7 / 2012-10-29

## 0.5.4/ 2012-09-25

  with content that was parsed from an xpath. (zrob)

* Parent XmlMapper classes may dictate the name of the tag for the child
  XmlMapper instances. (zrob)
