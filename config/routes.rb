  # The priority is based upon order of creation: first created -> highest priority.
  # See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes".


  # Example of regular route:
  #   get 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'

  # Example of named route that can be invoked with purchase_url(id: product.id)
  #   get 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', as: :purchase

  # Example resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
  
  resources :sessions, only: [:new, :create]
  resources :certifications, path_names: { new: "new/:vacols_id" } do
    get 'pdf', on: :member
    post 'confirm', on: :member
    get 'cancel', on: :member
  end

  scope "/dispatch", department: :dispatch do
    get '/', to: "tasks#index"
  end

  resources :offices, only: :index

  get "health-check", to: "health_checks#show"
  get "login" => "sessions#new"
  get "logout" => "sessions#destroy"

  get 'whats-new' => 'whats_new#show'

  get 'stats(/:interval)', to: 'stats#show', as: 'stats'

  get 'help' => 'help#show'

  # alias root to help; make sure to keep this below the canonical route so url_for works
  root 'help#show'

  mount PdfjsViewer::Rails::Engine => "/pdfjs", as: 'pdfjs'

  get "unauthorized" => "application#unauthorized"

  %w( 404 500 ).each do |code|
    get code, :to => "errors#show", :status_code => code
  end


  # Example resource route with options:
  #   resources :products do
  #     member do
  #       get 'short'
  #       post 'toggle'
  #     end
  #
  #     collection do
  #       get 'sold'
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments, :sales
  #     resource :seller
  #   end

  # Example resource route with more complex sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments
  #     resources :sales do
  #       get 'recent', on: :collection
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with concerns:
  #   concern :toggleable do
  #     post 'toggle'
  #   end
  #   resources :posts, concerns: :toggleable
  #   resources :photos, concerns: :toggleable

  # Example resource route within a namespace:
  #   namespace :admin do
  #     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
  #     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
  #     resources :products
  #   end
end
