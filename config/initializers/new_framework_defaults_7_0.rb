# Active Storage `has_many_attached` relationships will default to replacing the current collection instead of appending to it.

# See https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-active-storage-multiple-file-field-include-hidden for more information.
# Rails.application.config.active_storage.multiple_file_field_include_hidden = true
