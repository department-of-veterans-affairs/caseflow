# Example Makefile for developer convenience
#
# There's nothing here you can't do the long way. This is just a collection of (hopefully intuitive) shortcuts
# to ease common development tasks.
#
# To use this file:
#
#   % ln -s Makefile.example Makefile
#
# Examples:
#
#   # build all the docker db containers from scratch
#   % make build
#
#   # reset the dbs to the latest schema + seeds
#   % make reset
#
#   # run the dev server
#   % make run
#
#   # run all the linting tasks
#   % make lint security
#
#   # if you add a .git/hooks/pre-commit like this:
#   #!/bin/sh
#   exec make lint security
#
#   # then you can make sure all your code is lint-free on every commit.
#   # You can turn it off with:
#   % make unsafe
#
#   # and re-enable with
#   % make safe
#
#   # pulled latest from github? try:
#   % make install migrate
#
# Hopefully the targets are easy enough to remember to make this useful to others.
