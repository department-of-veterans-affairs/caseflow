    The VACOLS Issues API allows you to interact with a veteran’s VACOLS Issues. This API provides all VACOLS Issues per Veteran File Number.


    For more information on the Legacy Appeal process, including Legacy Issues, please see [this informative page on VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/legacy-appeals/).



    ## Technical Summary

    The VACOLS Issues API interacts with VA's internal system, called Caseflow, that manages all benefit appeals.

    * The VACOLS API accepts the veteran file number identification that is supplied in the request header.

    * The VACOLS Issue request will be validated to ensure the Veteran information matches VA records and that the appeal information sent is valid.

    * Detailed error messages will be returned to help your application provide meaningful information to the Veteran attempting to make the VACOLS Issue request.

    * The VACOLS Issues are paginated in the response. The page paramenter must be a integer greater than or equal to 1. 0 and negative numbers are defaulted to page 1.

    ## Authorization

    API requests are authorized through a token, provided in an HTTP header.
    Example _curl_ (assuming you're running Caseflow locally, and the `api_v3` feature toggle has been enabled):

    ```
     curl -v -H 'Authorization: Token {{YourApiKeyHere}}'\
    'http://localhost:3000/api/v3/issues/vacols/find_by_veteran/?page=2'

    ```
