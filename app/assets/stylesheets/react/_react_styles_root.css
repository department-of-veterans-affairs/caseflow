/*
 * We want our react components to be plug and play. The styles should be baked
 * into the component. This way a button is a button no matter where it's placed
 * and you don't have to look for the right css to pair with a given component.
 * To that end, we're putting react specific css in the following files.
 * If you add a component, add a corresponding css file here. Name all
 * styles with .react-<component_name>-<style_name>
 *
 *= require ./_loading_container.scss
