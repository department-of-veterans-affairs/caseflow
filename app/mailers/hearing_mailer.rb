# HearingMailer will:
# - Generate emails from the templates in app/views/hearing_mailer
#   - All types will use layouts/hearing_mailer.html.erb to determine the order of the sections
#     - Example section: :test_your_connection, :rescheduling_or_canceling_your_hearing
#   - The method name like "cancellation" determines which template is used.
#   - The 'cancellation' method uses app/views/hearing_mailer/cancellation.html.erb
#   - cancellation.html.erb prepends the recipient type and uses another template.
# - Generate email subjects based on the type of email.
# - Create the calendar invites that get attached to the emails.
