##
# Virtual hearing is a type of hearing where the veteran/appellant can have a hearing with a VLJ
# by joining a video conference from any device without having to travel to a VA facility.
# Caseflow integrates with a conferencing solution called Pexip to create conference rooms
# and uses GovDelivery to send email notifications to participants of hearing
# which includes the veteran/appellant, judge, and representative.
#
# This model tracks data about the conference rooms as well as the participant email address
# and whether the emails have been sent out. When a hearing coordinator switches a hearing to
# virtual hearing, CreateConferenceJob is kicked off to create a conference and send out
# emails to participants including the link to video conference as well as other details about
# the hearing. DeleteConferencesJob is kicked off to delete the conference resource
# when the the virtual hearing is cancelled or after the hearing takes place.
#
# A note about `status`:
#   * Status can be `cancelled`, `closed`, `active`, or `pending` *
#   `cancelled` : Initially virtual hearings could be only created when the hearing coordinator switched the hearing
#                 type (`Video` or `Central`) to virtual. If that type is switched back to the orginal type,
#                 this is tracked by `request_cancelled`. Essentially `cancelled` is derived from `request_cancelled`
#                 and indicates that the hearing type was switched back to original type and **NOT** that
#                 conference was deleted or hearing was cancelled.
#
#   `closed`: This is derived from `conference_deleted` which indicates that we deleted the conference that was created.
#             Though we delete conferences for every virtual hearing after the schedduled date, this helps us
#             distinguish between hearings which types were switched and hearings which were cancelled or postponed
#             because for the latter `request_cancelled` will not be set to `true`.
#
#   `active`: This indicates that the conference was created for a virtual hearing, derived from presence of
#             `conference_id` or presence of `host_hearing_link` and `guest_hearing_link`
#
#   `pending`: This indicates that the conference has yet to be created.
