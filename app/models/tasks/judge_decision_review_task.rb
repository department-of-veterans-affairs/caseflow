##
# Task for a judge to review decisions.
# A JudgeDecisionReviewTask implies that there is a decision that needs to be reviewed from an attorney.
# The case associated with this task appears in the judge's Cases to review view
# There should only ever be one open JudgeDecisionReviewTask at a time for an appeal.
# If an AttorneyTask is cancelled, we would want to cancel both it and its parent JudgeDecisionReviewTask
# and create a new JudgeAssignTask, because another assignment by a judge is needed.
