  def scheduled_for
    # returns the date and time a hearing is scheduled for in the regional office's
    # time zone
    #
    # When a hearing is scheduled, we save the hearing time to the scheduled_time
    # field. The time is converted to UTC upon save *relative to the timezone of
    # the user who saved it*, not relative to the timezone of the RO where the
    # veteran will attend the hearing. For example, if a user in New York
    # schedules an 8:30am hearing for a veteran in Los Angeles, the time will be
    # saved as 13:30 (with the eastern time -5 offset added) rather than 16:30
    # (with the pacific time -8 offset added).
    #
    # The offset will *always* be +5 for a user in the eastern time zone,
    # regardless of when the hearing is scheduled, because Rails associates a
    # date of 01 Jan 2000 with the time whenever it's read from the database.
    # Because that date did not fall during daylight savings time, the conversion
    # remains the same no matter what time of year it's done.
    #
    # So when we need to display the time the hearing is scheduled for, we have
    # to explicitly convert it to the time zone of the person who scheduled it,
    # then assemble and return a TimeWithZone object cast to the regional
    # office's time zone.
