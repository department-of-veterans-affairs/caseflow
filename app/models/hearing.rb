##
# The Veteran/Appellant, often with a representative, has a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge(VLJ) to
# provide additional details for their appeal. In this case the appeal is an AMA Appeal meaning it was filed
# after Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act (AMA) was passed.
#
# If the veterans/appellants opt in to have a hearing for their appeal process, an open ScheduleHearingTask is
# created to track the the status of hearings. Hearings are created when a hearing coordinator
# schedules the veteran/apellant for a hearing by completing the open ScheduleHearingTask.
#
# There are four types of hearings: travel board, in-person (also known as Central), video and virtual. Unlike the
# other types, virtual type has VirtualHearing model which tracks additional details about virtual conference
# and emails. Travel board hearings are only worked on in VACOLS.
#
# Hearings have a nil disposition unless the hearing is held, cancelled, postponed or the veteran/appellant
# does not show up for their hearing. AssignHearingDispositionTask is created after hearing has passed
# and allows users to set the disposition.
#
# A HearingDay organizes hearings by regional office and a room. Hearing has a HearingLocation where the
# hearing will place as well as a Trascription which is the trascribed record of the hearing if hearing was held.
# If a hearing is virtual then it has EmailEvents which is a record of virtual hearing emails sent to
# different recipients.

    # returns the date and time a hearing is scheduled for in the regional office's

    #
    # When a hearing is scheduled, we save the hearing time to the scheduled_time
    # field. The time is converted to UTC upon save *relative to the timezone of
    # the user who saved it*, not relative to the timezone of the RO where the
    # veteran will attend the hearing. For example, if a user in New York
    # schedules an 8:30am hearing for a veteran in Los Angeles, the time will be
    # saved as 13:30 (with the eastern time -5 offset added) rather than 16:30
    # (with the pacific time -8 offset added).
    #
    # The offset will *always* be +5 for a user in the eastern time zone,
    # regardless of when the hearing is scheduled, because Rails associates a
    # date of 01 Jan 2000 with the time whenever it's read from the database.
    # Because that date did not fall during daylight savings time, the conversion
    # remains the same no matter what time of year it's done.
    #
    # So when we need to display the time the hearing is scheduled for, we have
    # to explicitly convert it to the time zone of the person who scheduled it,
    # then assemble and return a TimeWithZone object cast to the regional
    # office's time zone.
