##
# HearingDay groups hearings, both AMA and legacy, by a regional office and a room at the BVA.
# Hearing Admin can create a HearingDay either individually or in bulk at the begining of
# each year by uploading bunch of spreadsheets.
#
# Each HearingDay has a request type which applies to all hearings associated for that day.
# Request types:
#   'V' (also known as video hearing):
#       The veteran/appellant travels to a regional office to have a hearing through video conference
#       with a VLJ (Veterans Law Judge) who joins from the board at Washington D.C.
#   'C' (also known as Central):
#       The veteran/appellant travels to the board in D.C to have a in-person hearing with the VLJ.
#   'T' (also known as travel board)
#       The VLJ travels to the the Veteran/Appellant's closest regional office to conduct the hearing.
#
# If the request type is video('V'), then the HearingDay has a regional office associated.
# Currently, a video hearing can be switched to a virtual hearing represented by VirtualHearing.
#
# Each HearingDay has a maximum number of hearings that can be held which is either based on the
# timezone of associated regional office or 12 if the request type is central('C).
#
# A HearingDay can be assigned to a judge.
