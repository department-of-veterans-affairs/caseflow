##
# The Veteran/Appellant, often with a representative, has a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge(VLJ) to
# provide additional details for their appeal. In this case the appeal is LegacyAppeal meaning it was filed
# before Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act (AMA) was passed.
#
# If the veterans/appellants opt in to have a hearing for their appeal process, an open ScheduleHearingTask is
# created to track the the status of hearings. Hearings are created when a hearing coordinator
# schedules the veteran/apellant for a hearing completing the open ScheduleHearingTask.
#
# There are four types of hearings: travel board, in-person (also known as Central), video and virtual. Unlike the
# other types, virtual type has VirtualHearing model which tracks additional details about virtual conference and
# emails. Travel board hearings are only worked on in VACOLS.
#
# The legacy hearings which are scheduled through caseflow are organized by a HearingDay by regional office and
# a room but all data is updated both in Caseflow and VACOLS. Caseflow also stores legacy hearings which
# were created in VACOLS. For these, there is no corresponding HearingDay in caseflow but it exists in VACOLS.
#
# Legcay Hearings have a nil disposition unless the hearing is held, cancelled, postponed or the veteran/appellant
# does not show up for their hearing. AssignHearingDispositionTask is created after hearing has passed
# and allows users to set the disposition.
#
# Legacy Hearing has a HearingLocation where the hearing will place. If a hearing is virtual then it has EmailEvents
# which is a record of virtual hearing emails sent to different recipients.
