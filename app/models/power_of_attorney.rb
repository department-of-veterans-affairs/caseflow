# A model that centralizes all information
# about the appellant's legal representation.
#
# Power of attorney (also referred to as "representative")
# is tied to the appeal in VACOLS, but it's tied to the veteran
# in BGS - so the two are ofen out of sync.
# This class exposes information from both systems
# and lets the user modify VACOLS with BGS information
# (but not the other way around).
#
# TODO: fetch POA address information from BGS
# TODO: fetch POA address information from VACOLS
# TODO: include the REP table in the VACOLS query and
# fetch representative name information from VACOLS
# TODO: we query VACOLS when the vacols methods are
# called, even if we've also queried VACOLS outside of this
# model but in the same request. is this something we should optimize?
