# This table consists of records that have repeatedly attempted
# to sync or be processed in some way but have continuously errored out.
# This table is polymorphic, records on this table could belong to more than one table.
# Records on this table are intended to be checked and fixed manually.

  # has_one vs has_many might change depending on the model

  # This method will report the stuck record to the appropriate places upon insertion e.g. slack channels
  # Params: Could be a PriorityEndProductSyncQueue record or a record from a different table
  # that has a has_one or has_many association with this table
