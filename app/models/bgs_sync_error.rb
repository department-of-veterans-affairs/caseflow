# Many BGS calls fail in off-hours because BGS has maintenance time, so it's useful to classify
# these transient errors and ignore the in our reporting tools. These are marked transient because
# they're self-resolving and a request can be retried (this typically happens during jobs)
#
# Only add new kinds of transient BGS errors when you have investigated that they are expected,
# and they happen frequently enough to pollute the alerts channel.
