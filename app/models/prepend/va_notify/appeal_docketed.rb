# Public: This Module is used to notify the appellant when an Appeal is Docketed
# and update the correlated record within the Appeal State Table.
# An Appeal is considered docketed when a DistributionTask is created.
# We prepend 'create_tasks_on_intake_success!' to notify the appellant that their appeal is docketed.
# This method is called upon the successful intake of an appeal
# that does not require a PreDocketTask (like when there are VHA Request Issues).
# We also prepend 'docket_appeal' to notify the appellant that their appeal is docketed.
# This method is called when a PreDocketTask is completed, causing a DistributionTask to be created.
# The method 'update_appeal_state_when_appeal_docketed' is an abstract method that is defined in app/models/tasks.rb
# There is a callback within app/models/task.rb that will trigger 'update_appeal_state_on_task_creation' to run
# whenever a task is created (which in turn calls 'update_appeal_state_when_appeal_docketed').  The method
# 'update_appeal_state_when_appeal_docketed' will check if task being created is a DistributionTask.
# If the created task
# is a DistributionTask, then the record correlated to the current task's appeal will have the column 'appeal_docketed'
# within the Appeal States table updated to be TRUE.
