# Contest Claims - Intaking Multiple Appellants
**Drafter**: Paula Bradin

## Background/Context
Caseflow needs to support the intake of multiple appellants/claimants. The main use case is for Contested Claims, where all claimants and associated POAs need to receive communication. While each claimant may have submitted their own 10182, they should all be associated to a unique claim.

## Overview
<!-- A brief summary of research, findings, and recommendations. -->

### Requirements and/or Acceptance Criteria
<!-- What requirements are being addressed? What acceptance criteria should be fulfilled by the solution? -->

### Concerns
<!-- Concerns about potential solutions. Explicitly state if they should be addressed in the chosen solution. -->

## Open Questions
Current thought is that a user would add multiple appellants in Queue (after Intake).  Does Intake need to be updated to allow for intaking multiple appellants?


## Implementation Options
<!-- 
Consider multiple implementation paths.
What are their recommended action items?
These may change as feedback is given, but after the tech spec is approved these should be written as fully defined/pointed github issues.
Is the work sufficiently defined such that someone else could pick it up?
Is the work parallelizable?
What new API endpoints, database fields / tables / models need to be defined?
How will we safely ship this work? Are there migrations, external dependencies that need to be notified, documentation changes, etc? -->

### Implementation concerns
<!-- List implementation-specific concerns about each option. -->


## Research Notes
<!-- Add any accrued research, links to relevant meeting notes, and sources of truth. This is also a good place to document any history to the recommended implementation - if feedback has changed the final approach, leave a note about it here -->
