# == Overview
#
# AppealState records are utilized to facilitate state machine-like behavior in order
# to track which status each appeal (AMA and Legacy) being processed in Caseflow is in.
#
# These states are most prominently used in the determination of which status to place in the
# 'Quarterly Notification' template whenever sending the quarterly correspondence to appellants.
# This is performed by the QuarterlyNotificationsJob.
