      <dt>How do I launch Caseflow?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Right now Caseflow only works with a new and unreleased version of VACOLS.
          To access this new VACOLS, press and hold the <kbd>Windows</kbd> Key (look for the <%= svg_icon(:windows_logo_old) %> or
          <%= svg_icon(:windows_logo) %> icon) and the letter <kbd>R</kbd> on your keyboard.
          A small dialogue box like the one shown below will open up.
        </p>

        <p>
          Copy and paste the following into the box and click the &quot;Run&quot; button:
          <kbd title="Click to copy" data-clipboard-text="\\bvacofil.dva.va.gov\dmdi$\ro\roaccesscf.vbs">\\bvacofil.dva.va.gov\dmdi$\ro\roaccesscf.vbs</kbd>

      <dt>How do I use Caseflow? </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Caseflow is already
          integrated with VACOLS. All you need to do is search for an Appeal ID
          and click the &quot;Certify Appeal&quot; in the search results or on
          the update appeal page. Once dates for the Form 9, NOD, SOC, and
          (optionally) SSOC have been entered into VACOLS, click the Certify
          Appeal button in the VACOLS search results window or the Update
          Appeal window.

          <%= image_tag 'help-page/help-certify-appeals.png', {alt: 'VACOLS screens'} %>
        </p>

        <p>
          Select VBMS paperless e-folder from the window that pops up then click certify.
            <%= image_tag 'help-page/help-certify-appeal-paperless.png', {alt: 'Certify Appeal'} %>
        </p>

        <p>
          The first time you use it you'll have to log in with your <strong>VA Username
          and Password</strong> <strong><em>AND</em></strong> your <strong>VACOLS regional office</strong> login.

          <%= image_tag 'help-page/ssoi-login.png', {alt: 'VA login screen'} %>

          <%= image_tag 'help-page/help-page-login.png', {alt: 'Caseflow login screen'} %>
        </p>

        <p>
          Once Caseflow is open, it will check to see if documents in the VBMS eFolder (such as
          the NOD, SOC, and Form 9) match the dates entered in VACOLS. If they
          do, not you will see a page similar to the one below, where you will be
          asked to fix the dates in either VACOLS or VBMS. Once you fix the
          dates click the <strong>Refresh </strong>button. If you can't find the document
          in the eFolder, the appeal cannot be certified and you'll need to
          click the <strong>This case cannot be certified</strong>.

          <%= image_tag 'help-page/help-page-finddocs.png', {alt: 'Find Missing Documents screen'} %>
        </p>

        <p>
          Once all the
          documents are detected, you'll see a page similar to the one below. There,
          you'll fill out details for the electronic Form 8. Once all of
          the forms have been completed, click the <strong>Preview Completed Form 8</strong>
          button to move on.

          <%= image_tag 'help-page/help-page-questions.png', {alt: 'Form 8 Questions screen'} %>
        </p>

        <p>
          On the next page, you'll be able to preview the completed Form 8. If anything
          looks incorrect, go back and fix it on the previous page. Otherwise,
          click the <strong>Upload and Certify</strong> link. The Form 8 will
          automatically be uploaded to the eFolder and the appeal will be
          certified to the Board of Veterans Appeals!

          <%= image_tag 'help-page/help-page-review.png', {alt: 'Preview Form 8 screen'} %>
        </p>

        <p>
          That's it! You'll receive a confirmation page indicating what you've done.
          You can now close the browser window and open up another appeal using VACOLS.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>What is Caseflow?</dt>
      <dd>Caseflow is a
      web-based tool that makes it easy to automatically fill out an
      electronic Form 8 and certify paperless appeals to the Board of
      Veterans Appeals. It automatically checks to make sure documents such
      as the Form 9, Notice of Disagreement (NOD), Statement of Case (SOC),
      and Supplemental Statement of Case (SSOC) have been added to an
      appeal.</dd>


      <dt>Who has access to Caseflow?</dt>
      <dd>Currently Caseflow is only available to a handful of users in select regional offices.
      This is to ensure that Caseflow meets the requirements laid out by
      our stakeholders, including you!</dd>


      <dt>Why do I need to login with two different IDs?</dt>
      <dd>We currently ask
      users to log in with both their VA credentials and their VACOLS
      credentials to ensure that the PII handled in Caseflow is secure. We
      realize that this is inconvenient and we're working on a fix that
      will allow you to only use VA credentials.</dd>


      <dt>Does Caseflow work with paper appeals?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          No. Caseflow only
          works with paperless appeals because we can't automatically detect
          files in a paper appeals.
        </p>

        <p>
          To certify a
          hardcopy or Virtual VA appeal, follow the same steps you have always
          taken but select the <strong>Hardcopy claims folder or Virtual VA</strong> when
          you click the <strong>Certify Appeal</strong> button in VACOLS to manually
          enter a Certification Date.

          <%= image_tag 'help-page/help-certify-appeal-paperless.png', {alt: 'Certify Appeal'} %>
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt>What new features are you working on?</dt>
      <dd>We heard from our
      early testers that generating and uploading letters is a big pain for
      VBA employees so we&#8217;re working on a way to make that easier.</dd>

      <dt>Who made Caseflow?</dt>
      <dd>Caseflow was
      developed by the Board of Veteran Appeals and the Digital Service in
      collaboration with VBA and users like you.
      </dd>

      <dt>What if I encounter a problem like a bug or Caseflow doesn't work?</dt>
      <dd>At the top of every
      page in Caseflow there is a <strong>Send feedback</strong> link like the one shown
      below that will let you send us questions, feature ideas, or issues
      you may encounter.
      <%= image_tag 'help-page/help-page-pilot-stage.png', {alt: 'Image of Send Feedback image'} %>
      </dd>

      <dt>What if Caseflow doesn't work for an appeal I'm trying to certify?</dt>
      <dd>If, for some reason,
      you canâ€™t certify an appeal using the new version of VACOLS or
      Caseflow you can go back to current version of VACOLS and certify the
      appeal as normal.</dd>
