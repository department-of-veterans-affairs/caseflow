  <h3>What if I wish to have a virtual tele-hearing?</h3>
  <p>
    Rather than traveling to a VA facility for a hearing, a virtual tele-hearing allows you to use a smartphone, computer, or tablet to meet with the judge from the location of your choice, including home.  Your device must have a reliable internet connection, a camera, and a microphone . Family or friends may assist you.  Your representative, if you have one, may join the hearing the same way from their location.
