  <h3>What is a virtual tele-hearing?</h3>
  <p>
    Rather than traveling to a VA facility for a hearing, a virtual tele-hearing allows you to use a smartphone, computer, or tablet to meet with a Judge from the location of your choice, including home.  Your device must have a reliable internet connection, a camera, and a microphone (which most mobile phones have). Family members or caregivers may assist you, and your representative, if you have one, may join the hearing the same way from their respective location.
  </p>
  <p>
    We strongly encourage you to consider requesting a virtual tele-hearing and enjoy the convenience that this new hearing type offers.
