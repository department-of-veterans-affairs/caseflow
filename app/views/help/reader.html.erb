  <h2 id="what-is-caseflow-reader">1. What is Caseflow Reader (or Reader)?</h2>

  <p>
    Caseflow Reader (or Reader) is a web-based prototype developed by the US Digital Service at VA that is designed to facilitate the attorney document review process for BVA appeals decisions. The application allows attorneys to review all of the eFolder documents associated with a Veteran's appeal and add categories, issue tags and comments to the documents to organize and streamline their review process. 
  </p>

  <h2 id="how-was-reader-developed">2. How was Reader developed?</h2>

  <p>
    The Digital Service team worked closely with attorneys and judges at BVA, and other stakeholders across the VA, to develop and test a Reader prototype. Using feedback from VA employees and human-centered design principles, they have tweaked and improved the tool steadily. They will continue to improve the tool based on feedback and as they have more opportunities to make things simpler.
  </p>

  <h2 id="how-to-access-reader">3. How do I access Reader?</h2>
  <p>
    You'll need to request access to Reader from your ISO by updating your 8824e form. 
    Once you've successfully gained access to Reader by updating your 8824e form, You can access Reader using the following link in Firefox. You'll see a pop window. Select the option to make an exception. Once on the login page, use your VBMS credentials to log in to Reader.<a href= 'https://appeals.cf.ds.va.gov/reader/appeal' target="_blank"> https://appeals.cf.ds.va.gov/reader/appeal/vacols_id/documents</a>. You'll need the VACOLS ID of the case you want to start reviewing. See the question below for more details about starting a new case.
  </p>

  <h2 id="start-a-case">4. How do I start a case in Reader?</h2>
  <P>

You'll need to replace the numbers "1234567" in the URL with the 7-digit number from VACOLS for the next case you want to work. For example, for a case with the VACOLS ID 3344556, open Firefox and navigate to <a href ='https://appeals.cf.ds.va.gov/reader/appeal/3344556/documents' target="_blank"> https://appeals.cf.ds.va.gov/reader/appeal/3344556/documents </a> to access the case.

  <p>
    Yes you can open a new tab by clicking on the doc type name in the upper right-hand corner when viewing a document. You can also click on the Reader icon to go back to all documents.
  </p>

  <h2 id="add-a-comment">11. How do I add a comment to a document in Reader?</h2>

  </p>

  <h2 id="delete-comments-in-reader">12. How do I delete comments in Reader?</h2>

  <p>
    While within a document, every comment box in the right hand menu contains a "delete" link above it, which you can click to remove the comment.
  </p>

  <h2 id="how-do-issue-tags-work">13. How do issue tags work?</h2>

  <p>
    You can add issue tags to documents to help you categorize, and later filter, documents by issue(s) as you review evidence. When you create an issue tag for the first time, it will appear in the dropdown menu so you can easily add it to other documents. Issue tags cannot be deleted from the dropdown menu for a case once added, but you can delete an individual issue tag within a document (there is no “delete all” issue tags function).  Issue tags do not persist across cases.
