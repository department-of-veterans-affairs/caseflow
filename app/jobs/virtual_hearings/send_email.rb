    # Why are we using `deliver_now!`? The documentation mentions that it ignores the flags:
    #
    #   * `perform_deliveries`
    #   * `raise_delivery_errors`
    #
    # https://github.com/mikel/mail/blob/8fbb17d4d5364c77cc870769d451bc2739b3a8ce/lib/mail/message.rb#L261-L272
    #
    # `perform_deliveries` we will always want to be true. There isn't an environment
    # where we wouldn't want to send emails (in the test environment this is already
    # stubbed out).
    #
    # `raise_delivery_errors` we want to be true, but this is the default. This flag
    # is mostly intended if you want to ignore errors when sending emails to invalid
    # email addresses (which we don't want). We want to break flow if GovDelivery
    # returns a non-successful error message, which it should do by default.
    #
    # In summary, ignoring those 2 flags is perfectly fine since we are ok with the
    # default behavior of them both being `true`.
    #
    # The benefit of using `deliver_now!` is that it returns the actual response from
    # GovDelivery. The actual web response gives Caseflow the ability to track
    # the email after it has been accepted by GovDelivery.
