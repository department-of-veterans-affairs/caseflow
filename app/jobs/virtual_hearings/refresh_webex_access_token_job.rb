# This file defines the RefreshWebexAccessTokenJob class, a job that refreshes the access token
# used for Webex API calls. This job is part of the VirtualHearings module.
#
# The job has the following key behaviors:
# 1. The perform method creates a new instance of WebexService and calls its
#    refresh_access_token method to get a new access token from the Webex API.
# 2. If the response from the Webex API is successful, the new access and refresh tokens are
#    stored in CredStash with the keys webex_#{Rails.deploy_env}_access_token and
#    webex_#{Rails.deploy_env}_refresh_token respectively.
# 3. If an error occurs during the process, it is caught and logged using the log_error method.
#
# This job is queued with low priority, indicating that it does not need to be run immediately
# and can wait until the system is less busy.
