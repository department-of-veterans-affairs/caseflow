**Configure shell env for Rosetta and x86_64 homebrew**

1. Open the terminal that was set up for “Open using Rosetta” above

2. Run the following command: `eval $(/usr/local/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)`

**Run dev setup scripts in Caseflow repo**

*Script 1*

1. Enter a rosetta terminal and ensure you are in the directory you cloned Caseflow repo into
(~/dev/appeals/caseflow), run commands \
    a. ```git checkout grant/setup-m1``` \
    b. ```./scripts/dev_env_setup_step1.sh``` \
    **If this fails, double check the “OpenSSL” section as well as your .zshrc file

*Script 2*

1. Open a rosetta terminal and navigate to /usr/local, run commands \
    a. ```sudo ln -s /usr/local/homebrew/opt optsource``` \
    b. ```sudo ln -s /usr/local/homebrew/Cellar Cellar``` \
    c. ```sudo spctl --global-disable```

2. Navigate to caseflow/scripts/dev_env_setup_step2.sh and open in VSCode

3. Make sure you are on the branch grant/setup-m1

4. Comment out line 12 (should be like the line in #5a)

5. In terminal navigate to caseflow folder, run
    * a. ```RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-openssl-dir=/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1" rbenv install 2.7.3```
    * b. `gem install pg:1.1.4 -- --with-pg-config=/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin/pg_config`
    * c. ```gem install therubyracer -- --with-v8-dir=/usr/local/homebrew/opt/v8@3.15```
        * i. If step c. fails try running these commands first

    ``` zsh
    brew install v8@3.15
    bundle config build.libv8 --with-system-v8
    bundle config build.therubyracer --with-v8-dir=$(brew --prefix v8@3.15)
    bundle install
    ```

    * d. ```./scripts/dev_env_setup_step2.sh```
    * If you get  a permission error while running gem install or bundle install, do not run using sudo.
    Set the permissions back to you for every directory under /.rbenv
        * Enter command: `sudo chown -R <your name under /Users> /Users/<your name>/.rbenv`
            * For example, if my name is Eli Brown, the command will be:
            `sudo chown –R elibrown /Users/elibrown/.rbenv`

6. If there are no obvious errors messages, run `bundle install` to ensure all gems are, in fact, installed

**Running Caseflow**

1. Open caseflow in VSCode (optional)

2. Ensure you are on master branch and up to date by running \
    a. ```git checkout master```\
    b. ```git fetch```\
    c. ```git pull origin master``` \
**Booz Allen Hamilton Internal**
3. Start Vacols UTM VM and log into it. Open the Docker and Postgres applications. Leave all running in background

4. In caseflow, run
    * a. `make down`
        * i.  Removes appeals-db, appeals-redis, and localstack docker containers
    * b. `docker-compose down –v`
        * i. Removes caseflow_postgresdata docker volume
    * c. `make up-m1`
        * i. Starts docker containers, volume, and network
    * d. `make reset`
        * i. Resets caseflow and ETL database schemas, seeds databases, and enables feature flags
        * **If `make reset` returns database not found error:
            * a. Run command `bundle exec rake db:drop`
            * b. Download caseflow-db-backup.gz (not able to share this download via policy, message me)
            * c. Enter terminal, navigate to ~/Downloads
            * e. Run command
                * i. `gzip -dck caseflow-db-backup.gz | docker exec -i appeals-db psql -U postgres`
                * ii. (this command will link the caseflow_certification_database to docker)
            * f. Download this [file](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging/releases/download/0.12.6-2/wkhtmltox-0.12.6-2.macos-cocoa.pkg) and move through the prompts (wkhtmltopdf => unrelated?)
            * g. Enter terminal, navigate to caseflow, and run \
            **Booz Allen Hamilton Internal**
                * i. `make up-m1`
                * ii. `make reset` (this will take a while)
                * iii. **Alternative fix for db not found error?
                    * a. ```bundle exec rake db:drop db:create db:schema:load```
                    * b. `bundle exec rake db:seed`
                    * c. `make install`
                    * d. `make test`
                        * i. This will time out before the command is finished executing. Have been told this is normal behavior if you have completed the VM Trigger Fix
                    * e. `make run-m1`
                        * i. Click <http://127.0.0.1:3000> to open caseflow in browser

5. After you are finished, go back to caseflow in VSCode, enter terminal, and run
    * a. `make install`
    * b. `make test`
        * i. This will time out before the command is finished executing. Have been told this is normal behavior if you have finished step 5
    * c. `make run-m1`
        * i. Click <http://127.0.0.1:3000> to open caseflow in browser
        * ii. If make run returns a message that the port is already running. Do the following:
            1. Find the port the error message is referring to. It should say close to the top of the error message
            2. Run command `lsof -i TCP:<port number here>`
            3. Run command `kill -9 <PID number here>`
            4. Run command `make run-m1 again`

After this, anytime I want to run Caseflow follow these steps:

1. Open the Docker app, Postgres app, and Vacols UTM, log in and leave running in background
2. Go to ~/Downloads and run `gzip -dck caseflow-db-backup.gz | docker exec -i appeals-db psql -U postgres`
3. `make up-m1`
4. `make run-m1` (if bootsnap errors, run this again and you should see a port is already running)
5. Run `lsof -i TCP:<port>`, then `kill –9 <pid>`
6. Run `make run-m1` again
